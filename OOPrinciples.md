# OO Principles

1. Encapsulate what varies

2. Program to an interface, not an implementation.

3. Favor composition over inheritance
- "HAS-A can be better than IS-A"

## Notes

- Design Patterns give you a shared vocabulary with other developers. Once you’ve got the vocabulary you can more easily communicate with other developers and inspire those who don’t know patterns to start learning them. It also elevates your thinking about architectures by letting you think at the pattern level, not the nitty-gritty object level.

- "Following the Open-Closed Principle usually introduces new levels of abstraction, which adds complexity to our code. You want to concentrate on those areas that are most likely to change in your designs and apply the principles there"
