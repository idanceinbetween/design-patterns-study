# Factory

## GoF Definition

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 
- Factory method *lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses*.
- In other words, the subclasses that derive from this abstract class perform the actual instantiation process.

## What problem does it solve?
Client does not need to know the creation details of the object needed.

## Side tracked learnings
- Abstract vs interfaces
