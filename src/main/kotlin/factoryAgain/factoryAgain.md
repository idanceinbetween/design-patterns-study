# Factory Method (again)

Code along with Head First Design Patterns because the examples are more awesome, and they actually illustrates the
problem they are trying to solve with opinionated perspectives on how to solve them.

## GoF Definition

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

## Key concepts

- This pattern is about encapsulating the instantiation of concrete classes
  
- This act of "reducing dependencies to concrete classes" (Head First Design Patterns) is called the
  Dependency Inversion Principle.
